I have dedicated my life to helping others and improving our world by practicing compassion and integrity on a daily basis. My hunger for knowledge has created a vast set of skills and interests including, programming, medical nutrition therapy, teaching, photography, and foreign languages. If I'm not working/coding, you'll probably find me on the volleyball court, taking artsy pictures of every cute animal possible, treating myself to different foods, making short highlight reels of my life adventures, taking on a new challenging skill, or trying to learn a new language. 様々な外国語ペラペラなりたいよ〜.",
